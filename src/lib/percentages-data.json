      "problem": "How many litres of pure acid are there in 8 litres of a 20% solution?",
      "solution": "The amount of pure acid is 20% of 8 litres. (20/100) * 8 = 0.20 * 8 = 1.6 litres. The correct option is 1.6."
    },
    {
      "problem": "A student multiplied a number by 4/5 instead of 5/4. What is the percentage error in the calculation?",
      "solution": "Let the number be x. The correct result is (5/4)x = 1.25x. The incorrect result is (4/5)x = 0.8x. The error is 1.25x - 0.8x = 0.45x. The percentage error is (Error / Correct Value) * 100 = (0.45x / 1.25x) * 100 = 36%. The correct option is 36."

    {
      "problem": "Due to an increment of 20% in the price of eggs, 5 less eggs are available for Rs. 200. What is the new rate of a dozen eggs?",
      "solution": "Let the original price per egg be P. The number of eggs for Rs. 200 is 200/P. The new price is 1.2P. The new number of eggs is 200/(1.2P). The difference is 5. So, (200/P) - (200/1.2P) = 5. Solving for P gives P = 6.66. The new price is 1.2 * 6.66 = Rs. 8 per egg. The rate for a dozen is 8 * 12 = Rs. 96. The correct option is Rs. 96."
